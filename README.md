# Project Title
Structure from Motion with Kornia: A Python Implementation

# Introduction
Structure from Motion (SfM) is a photogrammetric technique for estimating three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional image sequences. This project utilizes the Kornia library, a Python-based open-source library designed for computer vision tasks.

# Requirements
- Python 3.10 (tested on)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- Other libraries in requirements.txt

# Installation Instructions
clone the project, install requirements

# Usage
using the command prompt from the project root, run "python src\main.py", commandline arguments are also supported

# Todo
* improve data preparation code.
* add a workflow to append and optimize views for additional cameras gradualy, not all at once.

# Contributing
